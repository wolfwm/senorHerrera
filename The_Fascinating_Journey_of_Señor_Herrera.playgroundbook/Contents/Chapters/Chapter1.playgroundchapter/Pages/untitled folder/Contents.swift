/*:
 My name is Wolfgang Walder Marin.
 
 I'm a 26 year old Brazilian from São Paulo.
 
 I'm very passionate about metallurgy and blacksmithing (although I've never tried any blacksmithing myself)
 
 Señor Herrera's story is founded in my desire to, someday, smith a sword for myself, and my fascination for metallurgy.
